# Field Control Panel

Based on a Raspberry Pi 3 A, with a MegaIO hat. Goal is to have a web based interface to view and control various things on the field, eg, the electric fencing to the ~~velociraptor~~ horse/sheep paddocks, power supply to the IP cameras overseeing the ~~embryo storage fecility~~ field shelter, and exterior lighting around the ~~east dock~~ entrace gateway.

Eventually this will also be able to provide information such as battery voltage and current consumption, as well as information regarding the PV array and weather around ~~Isla Nublar~~ Blaby, UK.
